<h2>How to use this plugin?</h2> 
This plugin is actually a self-defined push-pop animation based on <i>UINavigationControllerDelegate</i>, animation class named <b>HPPhotoBrowserAnimation</b>.</br>

Step 1 : set up the navigation delegate and prepare required parameters by following what I had done in <b>ViewController</b>.Then u will get this cool effect.

<b>Notice</b></br>
1.This plugin is an animation plugin, not the photo browser plugin.You want a gorgerous UI, do it yourself :).</br>
2. This is not the latest version, I will update it later today, the final effect will be exactly the same with google photo.
